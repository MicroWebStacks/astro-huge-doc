# Changelog

## 0.0.11 - 2026-07-04

- Mermaid now renders client-side in the browser and no longer depends on
  Kroki, while PlantUML and BlockDiag continue using Kroki (engine 0.0.6).
- Mermaid diagrams now follow light/dark theme changes and support the full
  view modal in the preview.

## 0.0.10 - 2026-07-04

- Skip unreadable workspace folders while building the source tree, so preview
  startup no longer aborts on locked or permission-restricted cache
  directories (engine 0.0.5).

## 0.0.9 — 2026-07-04

First release under the new name **Markdown Site Preview**
(marketplace ID `microwebstacks.markdown-site-preview`, previously published
as `microwebstacks.microwebstacks-docs-preview`).

- Pages menu now mirrors the source folder structure in the lite preview
  (engine 0.0.4), matching the full website behavior.
- Outline shows per-section table and diagram markers.
- New browser-window icon, marketplace page with screenshot, and reworked README.
